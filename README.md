# INFORMS-General_Motors_project

INFORMS Competition provided a real-world business problem, helping General Motors analyze how autonomous vehicles may change the companyâ€™s vehicle delivery and operating process. The problem involves designing a vehicle delivery network, with the objective of minimizing the total costs while satisfying all constraints.

Due to time constraint and limited knowledge, we could solve only some part of it. Taking into consideration the static routing using two modes, we calculated the minimum costs for delivering the vehicles. 
The repository has .lp file defining the objective function and the constraints for it. And also rmd file for optimizing the objective value and getting the variables.
